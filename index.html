      Childhood lunches are the roots of Ambient Music

    <p id="abstract">

      With our camcorders and mobile phones, we often prefer to capture
        moments of everyday life that we want to remember, usually good
        memories. We tend to leave out of the frame those traumas and
        experiences we would rather forget. Often, however, even the memories we
        decide not to frame are suffocated by the distortion and romanticization
        that the nostalgia filter automatically activates in our minds, no
        longer allowing us to understand what is or is not real.<br />
        This thesis analyses the concept of nostalgia and its use in four
        different film, investigating how it is used as a tool to express the
        aesthetics and poetics of this experience. Through understanding
        nostalgia and the power of it, I use this experience as a tool to
        analyse and describe the archive of videos shot by my parents between
        1994 and 2001. I translate then this analyses in text-collages through
        the use of the literary cut-up technique, used it by the Dadaist in the
        20s and Willam S. Burroughs in the 50s; I narrated, cutted, and pasted
        together in a random (but conscious) way to describe, questioning, and
        investigate memories; recreating an aesthetic that is at times tangible
        and at times ethereal, at times attractive and at times disturbing,
        recreating the hidden side of these memories and what the video camera
        cannot see but can perceive.

      It all started a few days before I left Berlin to return to Den Haag.
      During one of the sessions with my psychologist, I explained to her how I
      missed that city and home even before I left and about the good German
      experience I had had. After a few minutes of monologue, my psychologist
      asks me if I remember what I was telling her a few weeks earlier when we
      started the sessions. I tell her that I don't remember what but I only
      remember my emotional state. I almost deny that I had bad memories in
      Berlin and still perhaps do. She offers to read me the notes she took
      during the first sessions. I tell her that I don’t want to hear them again
      but slowly as the talk continues these missing pieces come out of my mind
      without any permission, almost as if this barrier I have created for
      myself has stopped working.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nostalgia is an experience that has always been present in my life, in my
      way of thinking and in my way of creating even though I may never have
      realized in which way and how much it affected me. I am a person who tends
      to look at the past with melancholy, often distorting what remains of the
      memories I have. I don’t want to sound dramatic but sometimes I wonder
      what is true about my past and what is not. I don’t mean as if nothing
      ever happened, but how my perception of that moment is distorted by this
      mental filter that allows me to romanticize it. I was almost surprised at
      the earlier stage of this thesis when I realize that I never investigated,
      analysed, or researched the true (whatever that means) or academic meaning
      of nostalgia before. Like when you do something so naturally that you are
      not aware of its presence, as it simply exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting from the roots and the feeling of researching such natural
      experience, I found interesting thoughts from the historian Karin
      Johannisson<sup>1</sup> in <i>Nostalgia: The History of an Emotion</i>. She argues
      about the importance of naming an emotion to be able to explore and
      analyze it almost like a medical diagnosis, and that our identification of
      this emotion, in our case nostalgia, changes according to the times, thus
      in the current use of the term, and that the semantic process is important
      in deriving meaning to match our feelings. I’m thinking about a famous
      quote from François de La Rochefoucauld that says that there are people
      who would never have fallen in love if they had never heard of love. Human
      has always tended to want to give an explanation for everything. For
      example, German sociologist Arnold Gehlen<sup>2</sup> said that the concept of 'home’
      can be defined as an invention of man, who is the only member of the
      animal world who does not have the ability to survive in his own
      environment. Instead of trusting his own natural instincts, he puts his
      trust in institutions such as the state or the family.
      <span class="margin">
        The same goes for nostalgia, an experience rather than an emotion. I
        like to think of the idea of the 'discovery' of nostalgia. It was
        initially defined as a medical condition. Johannes Hofer<sup>3</sup> created the
        term nostalgia in 1688, <i>nostos</i> (return home) +
        <i>algia</i> (longing), a word already sorts of nostalgic in its
        composition for the use of Greek words. Hofer wanted to give a name to
        the feeling of anxiety and depression that Swisse mercenaries sent away
        from their country felt. The distance from home and family. I wonder if
        animals suffer from homesickness. Sometimes I think of the flies that
        sneak into buses in route and when they come out, they find themselves
        in different places.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The theorist Svetlana Boym<sup>4</sup> added centuries later that nostalgia does not
      only refer to a place but also to time, and that time does not only refer
      to objective time such as historical time but also to personal and
      subjective time such as childhood. We have slowly moved from treating
      nostalgia as a medical condition to a philosophical and psychological one.
      We certainly cannot define nostalgia with one word, in the cultures of the
      world there are several different ways of defining this personal and
      objective feeling at the same time. Boym, in her book
      <i>Nostalgia and its discontents</i> divides nostalgia into two different
      categories: <i>restorative</i> and <i>reflective</i> nostalgia. These
      types of nostalgia represent two different ways of approaching the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Restorative nostalgia</i> is more focused on the concept of home and
      its reconstruction. It looks at the past as tradition and a return to its
      origins. We can observe this phenomenon and understand the existence of
      two sides of the same almost paradoxical coin. On one hand, it is based on
      the sense of loss of a community by offering a sense of belonging and
      unity of the individual within this group. On the other hand, this sense
      of cohesion can be dragged along by a much deeper sense of belonging that
      can result in ethnic/cultural/national ideology, and the creation of an
      imaginary enemy that wants to attack our traditions, our past, from which
      one must inevitably defend oneself to protect one's community. In recent
      decades, we can find various examples in different political parties
      around the world that have leveraged using this sense of nostalgia as the
      workhorse of their election campaigns and received excellent results in
      most cases because it is more direct to convey and to be understood and
      perceived by the citizens.<br />
      <span class="margin"
        ><i>Reflective nostalgia</i>, on the other hand, favours an aesthetic of
        the past that concerns a more individual and historical time, embracing
        in a more philosophical sense, thinking about the passage of time.
        Instead, the recreation of the lost home or the protection from its slow
        ruin, or its renovation, the place is just observed while all of this is
        happening. As Boym writes, after quoting Marcel Proust and the flow of
        memories that a small gesture or object can trigger:</span>
    </p>

    <p id="quote">
      <i>"It is this memorable literary fugue, then, that matters, not the
        return home."</i
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      As we have come to understand reflective nostalgia explores a more
      subjective and almost private world that can lead to very interesting
      results and discussions when approached or used through mediums such as
      philosophy or different art forms, never having a common and tangible
      final form, as we appeal to personal and more ethereal feelings. In the
      art world, nostalgia is a theme that has been addressed through different
      mediums and in different centuries, and perhaps in a way, this is one of
      those feelings that allows art to survive.<br />
      <span class="margin">
        <i>The Neoclassicist</i> current, that developed around the middle of
        the 18th century is precisely based on a fascination with the past,
        although on reflection I would liken this current more to a type of
        restorative nostalgia, as it is closer to the search for a sense of
        belonging in the classical world. Interest in the ancient world had been
        reborn after the discoveries of Pompeii and Herculaneum, which marked
        the century. What distinguished this artistic style was an adherence to
        and return to the principles of classical art, they wanted to revive the
        principles of harmony, proportion, and balance that had been the pillar
        of Greek and Roman art.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are thinking about nostalgia in art and in contemporary times, we
      can find many examples in the cinematography field. Movies, short movies
      or videos are the tools with which this experience is best and most fully
      translated, through the use of specific shots, lighting effects, and the
      soundtrack. In more recent times we can find different movies that are
      using this nostalgic filter as a main tool to show and tell stories, in
      most of these cases nostalgia is the silent character (sometimes the main
      silent character) that is speaking without actually speak.<br />
      <span class="margin">
        One example is Federico Fellini's film <i>Amarcord</i> (1973). Already
        from the title we understand that the film is based on the director's
        memories of his youth in a town that only from the dialect we can tell
        is located in Romagna. "Amarcord" in fact comes from the Romagnolo
        dialect “A M’ARCORD”, in Italian “Mi ricordo”, “I remember”. The
        emphasis is going to the first “A” in the title, like a sigh at the
        beginning of the telling of a story dear to the narrator. The film
        slowly fades between the hues of the seasons and the color of the town's
        bricks and the beautiful soundtrack from Nino Rota, narrating different
        moments in the director's life during the ‘30s. Characters and events
        are distorted between the director's memories, faces more like Commedia
        dell'Arte masks than real people. As Fellini's town is very close to
        mine and the dialect is the same, I always tend to be a little moved
        every time I watch this film. It remindes of my aunt’s stories of
        picturesque characters, too absurd to seem real, their stories and their
        nicknames.</span>

    <p>
      Another example of nostalgia in the world of filmmaking and closer to our
      decades is the Netflix series <i>Stranger Things</i>. The whole series is
      a true celebration of the 1980s, in almost every aspect. Let's think for
      instance of the first sequence of the main character having an adventure
      playing the role-game Dungeons and Dragons. Think about the clothes the
      children wear, the soundtrack, the terror of the Cold War between the US
      and the Soviet Union that forms the background and is never directly
      addressed, or the different genres that the series itself represents i.e.
      a big mix of sci-fi, mystery, horror and fantasy movies.

      brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, we can even find a sense of nostalgia in films that were
      not conceived with this narrative purpose but which we tend to look at
      from this perspective. Take for instance the muted movie
      <i>L'Arrivée d'un train à La Ciotat</i> (1896) by Auguste and Louis
      Lumière. Although the original purpose of the film was to experiment with
      a new technique, in recent years our attention has slowly shifted from
      analyzing the medium used to analyzing what is shown to us. Probably also
      due to the various re-shares of the video on YouTube and the addition of
      music in the background. Although the film does not have a specific plot,
      it shows a scene of everyday life without main actors but with a
      multiplicity of events happening simultaneously, almost like a painting by
      Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The filmmakers are unconsciously documenting a
      way of life that is now far removed from our present.<br /> <span class="margin">
      This sequence makes us think about the passage of time and the distance
      from the present to a simpler world.

      The movie <i>Aftersun</i> (2022) by Charlotte Wells resonates a lot with
      me in the use of nostalgia and the themes that she is exploring. In this
      movie nostalgia and memories are per se analysed, and not just used as
      tools, which was the case in the movies previously mentioned. The
      filmmaker investigates the relationship between a father and a daughter
      during a holiday at a resort in Turkey in the 1990s. The film is told from
      the child's point of view, mixing clean scenes with the movie camera and
      glitchy scenes of the camcorder that were used in the 1990s. Nostalgia in
      this case is not only used as an aesthetic but also as an analysis of the
      relationship the protagonist has with her father. Scenes are shown
      sometimes briefly and sometimes more extensively, making us slowly
      discover two sides of their relationship that often match and sometimes
      repel, showing us new sides of their relationship, or different sides of
      her father. Charlotte Wells's skill lies in never explicitly telling us what
      is going on, so we find ourselves trying to understand and analyse the
      situations, finding ourselves in the same shoes as the daughter trying to
      remember her father and her relationship with him, all of which continues
      to be opaque with a few flashes of reality, but we don't know if it is the
      “real” reality.<br />
      <span class="margin">
      I got very emotional watching this film perhaps because I empathized with
      the main character and this careful analysis of her past and her
      relationship with her parent. In Aftersun we find a non-linearity in the
      narrative. The only linearity we find, and on which the film rests, is the
      beginning with the daughter's arrival in Turkey and the end with her
      departure. Inside, between the beginning and the end, we are shown several
      scenes that could almost survive on their own, like short films.</span>
    </p>

    <img id="Aftersun" src="images/aftersun.webp" alt="picture" />
    <p class="figure">[Fig 4.] Scene from <i>Aftersun</i>(2022), Charlotte Wells.</p>
    <p>
      Like the main character in this movie, in the last months I spent hours
      watching videos from my family archive shot from my parents between 1994
      and 2001, trying to understand what my life was like, and how it is and
      was the relationship with my family and my parents, the relationship with
      my home and the space around me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrative approach Charlotte Wells uses in <i>Aftersun</i> has been an
      inspiration for the research I have been doing for the past few months,
      its non-linearity, the perceived and the unperceived. I recently
      approached a literary technique called cut-up, in which I found many
      similarities in the narrative used by the director. The cut-up technique
      is a literary method in which a text is cut into fragments and rearranged
      to create a casual new composition of text, initially tried by the
      Dadaists in the 1920s and made popular again with William S. Burroughs in
      the 1950s and 1960s. The cut-up has been used as a means to explore the
      semantic and sound potential of words, creating new associations and
      meanings through random assembly. This technique can lead to surprising
      and unexpected results that might not be achievable with a traditional
      approach to writing, explore and create a non-linear and sperimental way
      of producing and exploring the unconscious mind.<br />
      <span class="margin">
      In my text collage, like in Aftersun, the coherent narrative and the
      emotions are break apart and leave the reader with a sense of
      disorientation and ambiguity. The personal and the objective are both
      involved, this allowed to explore the memories and feelings in a
      non-linear, associative way that reflects the personal and unique
      perspective of the reader, and disrupt their sense of time and space.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was interesting to experiment with the use of the cut-up technique. I
      had similar results that a film could give, recreating a kind of
      'nostalgia video filter', translating my videos that have a certain visual
      power, like the films mentioned above, into a collage-text full of images
      and emotions. I found it liberating being able to play with the perception
      of the past and the present, decomposing the narrative structure of what I
      was writing I slowly let go of these sometimes contradictory fragments of
      my memories and experiences, leading me to reflect on my relationship with
      the past, my family and myself. These videos manage to give a clear shape
      to these vague memories of my childhood. I'm thinking that sometimes we
      have the physical memory but it’s always difficult to think what was on
      our mind back then. Watching these videos has a strange effect on me. It's
      almost like watching a TV show, everyone is an actor who occasionally
      appears and disappears with cameos. My parents never appear together, one
      of them in turns always holds the camera. I am not watching myself; I am
      watching an actor impersonating myself. I live this life a thousand times.<br />
      <span class="margin">
      There is a scene in which my father touches my ears, nose, and mouth. When
      I watch it, I try to close my eyes and try to recreate that feeling, I try
      to imagine my dad's big rough hands, I try to imagine the texture of my
      skin, I try to think about still wearing that round face with features yet
      to be defined. I have tried to narrate my memories trying to get to the
      bottom of my analysis and that of my surroundings even though my
      perception of certain memories will probably change as time goes by and
      new relics from the past will probably emerge from my head.
      </span> <br />
    Like a never-ending story.<br />
    <span class="margin">
      I’ll just let myself be carried away again by the swinging of this white
      sea and the memories will continue to flow like a flux, mingling.</span>
